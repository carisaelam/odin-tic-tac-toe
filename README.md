# Tic Tac Toe game in Ruby for TOP 

I created this project as part of The Odin Project's Ruby curriculum. The goal was to build a command-line Tic-Tac-Toe game that allows two players to play against each other. Throughout the development, I focused on implementing core Ruby concepts such as classes, methods, and conditional statements. The game prompts each player to enter their name and then alternates turns until there is a winner or a draw. This project helped me solidify my understanding of basic game logic and user input handling in Ruby.
